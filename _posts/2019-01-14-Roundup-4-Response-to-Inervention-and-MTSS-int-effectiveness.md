It has been a while since I last posted a Roundup, I'm sorry for those that look forward to these. My work has been quite busy lately working with schools to implement Multi-Tiered Systems of Support. Due to this work I have been thinking a lot lately, and reading some, about how best to implement MTSS. This seems to be a difficult question to answer, a lot of research is done in controlled conditions and what might work in those conditions might not in the real world. One of the articles I read and decided to share in this roundup speaks to that exactly.

All four articles in this roundup discuss the effectiveness of interventions at tier 2 and, in a couple of the articles, the authors make recommendations for more effective interventions.

I have two more roundups in the works, all having to do with MTSS. This one is all about tier 2 effectiveness, the next will be about MTSS implementation, and the final in the series will be about RtI decision making (I may switch up that order).

As usual, feel free to contact me using any of the methods on the sidebar. A PDF version of this is also on the sidebar.

Enjoy!

In this article the authors describe tier 2 intervention models in secondary schools, particularly in math. I found this article to be very timely for me, as one of the schools I am working with at the moment is a middle school and is wrestling with this exact problem, how does a secondary school best implement RtI? This is challenging in the secondary schools for a number of reasons. I found this quote on page 241 especially informative:
>Inherent features of secondary education, including the structure of the day (e.g., changing class periods and the limited time per class) and other issues, can result in RtI implementation—and research—being more challenging (Fuchs, Fuchs, & Compton, 2010; Prewett et al., 2012). Resistance among educators was also noted as a challenge with using RtI models in secondary schools (Sansosti, Noltemeyer, & Goss, 2010). Another issue with RtI implementation at the secondary level is that fewer evidence-based interventions exist, but most mathematics interventions are focused on elementary students (Sansosti et al., 2010).

The authors propose four models for RtI in secondary schools at tier 2:
1. Having an additional math class, either in the form of an extended block or additional period, in which all students can receive further intervention and not miss tier 1 instruction. A challenge with this model is that it might have implications on contact time for other classes and could become a challenge for credits and graduation. Not in the article, but something I thought of as a challenge when reading this method was the challenge of teacher schedules, what do you take away in order to give this extra period?  
2. Small group pullout instruction, which sounds great, but also comes with many challenges. One of the overwhelming positives is that students can receive small group instruction targeted to their needs. One of the major challenges is logistics, who provides these interventions and where? Does the school need to hire another teacher, or teachers?
3. Alternative Math Class, which involves students taking an alternative to their tier 1 math class. In this model students are grouped according to needs and are given instruction according to their specific gaps. A major downside is that this leads to tracking and students may never make it back to tier 1 instruction. This goes against the principles of RtI and MTSS in that students should be receiving intervention as long as they need, but not forever. It also removes the problem solving nature of MTSS.
4. Technology tools, like apps and programs on computers, can be used to supplement instruction. This could be beneficial for students to focus on individual needs, but requires access to, and a certain level of fluency with, technology.  

Given all of the pros and cons the authors conclude that the additional math block time has the most potential for changing how students learn math. In these blocks teachers can group students according to need and give them the additional instruction they need. The authors go on to state that, regardless of the delivery model chosen, it is important to "consult the research to select and validate interventions chosen for implementation." Given the limited research, the authors give four examples of evidence-based practices for tier 2 math in secondary schools:
1. Explicit instruction, which they describe as "An instructional sequence involving the teacher first modeling how to solve the mathematics and then cuing the students to solve the problem as needed, and finally the student solves the problems independently". See [Archer](https://explicitinstruction.org/) or [Hollingsworth](https://dataworks-ed.com/) for more on Explicit Instruction. I'll add my own little bit here on explicit instruction, I argue, based on multiple books and studies, that explicit instruction is the foundation for tier 1 instruction for students who struggle, come from poverty, ELLs, and SWDs. I was a little surprised to see it listed here as tier 2.   
2. Concrete-Representational-Abstract (CRA) instructional sequence. "The Concrete-Representational-Abstract instructional sequence is an
explicit instruction model in which students are first provided
instruction with concrete manipulatives to use to solve math
problems. When students are successful, they move into solving the
math problems with representations or drawings. Finally, students
solve the problems abstractly (without concrete manipulatives or
drawings)".
3. Schema-based instruction. "Teachers help students to understand word problems by categorizing
problems via structure, such as change or compare problems.
Students then create diagrams to depict the schemas to solve.
e.g., FOPS (find the problem, organize the information via a diagram,
plan to solve, and then solve)".
4. Number talks. "the teacher poses a math problem. First, students think how to
mentally solve the problem and then share the multiple solutions
they devised
 Builds conceptual understanding and fluency (i.e., number sense)"

Shameless plug: I actually made a short video quickly describing CRA and SBI (2 and 3) for my colleagues. It is on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/CDXx9p9Xx8c). Not one of my best, but you can get a sense of it from the video.

Overall this article helped me by validating the struggles schools have in implementing RtI in secondary schools, by validating some practices that I had learned about through my work on a state wide work group, and by stressing the importance of finding evidence-based practices. I can see giving this to those that want to conceptualize RtI in their schools, its a good introduction.

When I received the latest issue of *Learning Disabilities Research and Practice* and saw this article my interest was piqued. As the title states, the authors used a quasi-experimental design to find out if inverting the tiers of intervention was more effective than traditional methods. For those that are confused, which may be nobody, the traditional method of RtI or MTSS is that everyone receives tier 1, core instruction, all of the time. When a student or students are struggling they are identified using either a universal screener or in class assessments to receive interventions in addition to their tier 1 instruction. Those that are still struggling move to tier 3. In this model the researchers explored if, using "dynamic RtI", a student could skip tier 2 and go directly to tier 3, and if so, would that student perform better after intervention?

As the authors acknowledge, this is not the first time this has been tested. A group of researchers in 2014, Al Otaiba, Kim, Wanzek, Petscher, and Wagner, tested "dynamic RtI" vs traditional RtI and found no significant diffrences between the two for fall reading scores, but found significantly higher scores for the dynamic group in spring. This study differentiated itself in that tier 3 was delivered as one-on-one tutoring whereas the study in 2014 was groups of 1-3 students.
